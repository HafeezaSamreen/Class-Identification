# Class-Identification-in-Buildings
In recent years, high resolution Satellite images have been used with image processing for various classifications. Among these, Class Identification of Buildings due to many disasters is necessary for land analysis and urban monitoring. The automatic method is able to detect the different classes of buildings as Vanishing, Emerging, Unchanged. But there are various challenges involved in identifying the classes, a potential solution Deep Learning, specifically the CNN model is used to determine the classes based on the pre-images and post-images of buildings in a place at different times. In the proposed model, the urban areas satellite imagery with both before and after images are used to classify with different colors for each classification of buildings. To this end, two CNN model namely, U-Net and ResNet50 are applied for the images collected to determine the model that outperform the existing methodologies in both Segmentation and Classification. Various evaluation metrics, namely Accuracy, F1 Score, training loss, testing loss are used to determine the best model to obtain the better results for classification of buildings.
